## Description
This SwiftUI app displays three holiday themed tabs: **Halloween**, **Thanksgiving**, and **Christmas** using a `TabView`.  
Each tab shows a list of SF Symbol icons and a descriptive title for that holiday.

The goal of this homework is to demonstrate:
- How to use **TabView** to create multiple tabs in a SwiftUI app.  
- How to organize code using **separate View structs** for each screen.  
- How to display **SF Symbols** and **Text** using **VStack**.
